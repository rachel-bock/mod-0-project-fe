## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* A Growth mindset asks the question "What do I need to learn to overcome this obstacle?"  It allows me to focus on what to learn instead of panicking when I don't know something.
* I can always learn.
* Don't compare myself to others.  Track my own progress (where I am today vs. where I was a year ago for example).

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by being willing to learn from my mistakes.  I demonstrate a fixed mindset when I think that I already know a subject and don't open up to asking questions about things that I am struggling with.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I didn't really notice that the instructions had been made more vague.  I knew how to run a file in node so doing so was not difficult.  Having to complete some of the more complex logical statements was more difficult without clear instructions on what to do.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is a way of running a specific set of instructions based on whether or not a specific condition has been fulfilled.  An example of a daily life conditional would be the following:

If the kids are sick, they will stay home.  Otherwise, they will go to school.

An example of a conditional in a web application I use may be "if the dollar amount is negative, then highlight it in red.  Otherwise, use a black font."

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To have multiple conditions, we use else if.  For example, if a condition is not met, then the next condition is considered.  If the second condition is not met, then the third condition is considered.  Once a condition is met, then the code block after that condition will be run.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

The easiest way I can think of to check if multiple conditions are true is by using the the logical and to join the two conditions in the conditional statement.  The other option is to use the logical or to see if one of the two conditions are met.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Is there a rule of thumb when we would use a switch statement instead of an if / else if / else statement?
