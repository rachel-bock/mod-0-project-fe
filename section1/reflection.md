## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I do not like to ask questions because it feels like a burden to
others. I will tend to wait to long to ask questions.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Strings are text sentences or words that are surrounded by quotes.
Numbers are mathematical figures aka numbers.
Boolean values are either true or false and represent a logical
value.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

For a single line of comments, I would use the `//`.  For
comments that are either within the line of code or are multiple 
lines of comments, I would use the `/* */` notation.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a place to store a value.  It is the label we give
the value so that we can use it or refer to it later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Category - String
Payee - String
Amount - Number

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is when we "join together" at least two strings.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

In my medical app, the app says "Good morning, Rachel" or "Good evening, Rachel" and uses my name as well as the time of day.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Why are we not allowed to use let instead of var? 
Can I use VSCode instead of Atom as my code editor? 
Is it okay if I make more commits to my project than just when 
the instructions say to make a commit?
Is there going to be a use for the Study Hall?
