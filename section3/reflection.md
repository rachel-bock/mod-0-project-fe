## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

I don't like it.  I don't want to be self-taught and I don't like doing "pre-teaching" prior to a lecture or "post-teaching" after the lecture to ensure I understand the materials.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Spotify probably uses arrays to organize playlists of songs. A playlist is an ordered list of songs.  

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a function that is meant to be used on arrays specifically.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is used when the action needs to be taken multiple times.  A loop is used with an array 
when the action is done for each and every item in the list.  

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is when you repeat something over and over again.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I could come up with a few questions that I already know the answers to.  For example, how do you access the
element of a nested array?  By using bracket notation for each of the arrays such as in "array[0][3]" to access
the 4th element in the first array in the variable.
